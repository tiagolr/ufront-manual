HttpRequest
===========

The `HttpRequest` object gives you access to all the parameters supplied by the client's browser in the current request.

Each platform (Neko, PHP, NodeJS etc) will have it's own implementation, allowing you to access these details in a consistent way across platforms.
Many of these properties can be accessed using `neko.Web` or `php.Web`, but `HttpRequest` smooths across the differences, and allows other platforms where a static implementation does not make sense, such as NodeJS, to also have a valid implementation.

### Access

You can access the `HttpRequest` anytime you have a `HttpContext` object, using `myHttpContext.request`.
While writing code inside a controller, there is a `public var context:HttpContext` that you have access to.
So at any time in a controller, you can use `var req = context.request` to get the current HttpRequest.

### Basic Usage

```haxe
var req = context.request;

req.hostName;                      // "ufront.net"
req.clientIP;                      // "165.68.163.140"
req.uri;                           // "/anything/after/the/domain/file.html"
req.httpMethod;                    // "GET" or "POST" etc.
req.scriptDirectory;               // "/var/www/my-site/" (path to index.n or index.php)
req.queryString;                   // "" or "search=tight pants&sort[]=tightest&sort[]=cheapest"
req.query;                         // [ "search"=>["tight pants"], "sort"=>["tightest","cheapest"] ];
req.query["search"];               // "tight pants"
req.query["sort"];                 // "cheapest"
req.query.get("search");           // "tight pants"
req.query.getAll("sort");          // ["tightest","cheapest"]
req.postString;                    // "" or "to[]=Vadar&to[]=Luke&subject=Re: death star&text=sorry about that", if "enctype=application/x-www-form-urlencoded"
req.post;                          // [ "to"=>["Vadar","Luke"], "subject"=>["Re: death star"], "text"=>["sorry about that"] ]
req.post.get("subject");           // "Re: death star"
req.post["to"];                    // "Luke"
req.post.getAll("to");             // ["Vadar","Luke"]
req.cookies;                       // [] or [ "sessionID"=>["123456"], "checkpoints"=>["homepage","pricing","signup"] ]
req.cookies["sessionID"];          // "123456"
req.cookies.get("checkpoints");    // "signup"
req.cookies.getAll("checkpoints"); // ["homepage","pricing","signup"]
req.params;                        // Combination of post, query and cookies.
req.params["search"];              // "tight pants"
req.params.getAll("checkpoints");  // ["homepage","pricing","signup"]
req.params.get("subject");         // "Re: death star"
req.files;                         // MultiValueMap of FileUpload objects - still being built.
req.authorization;                 // null or { user: "randle", pass: "correcthorsebatterystaple" }
req.authorization.user;            // "randle"
req.authorization.pass;            // "correcthorsebatterystaple"
req.userAgent;                     // UserAgent object.
req.isMultipart();                 // true or false, depending on if this is a multipart request.
req.parseMultipart(...);           // Process a multipart object manually. Usually better to use an upload handling middleware.
```

See the API documentation for detailed information on each of these properties.

### Retrieving Multiple Parameters With the Same Name

When developing a site or an app, it is fairly common to have an option where a user can select multiple values.

Some examples:

* A `<select multiple>` box for choosing the category for a blog post.
* A group of checkboxes for ticking which mailing lists the user wishes to subscribe to.
* A repeatable text input for entering different phone numbers for the same user.

PHP handles this in a different way to other platforms, so it is worth exploring the differences.

In PHP, you can write code like this:

	<input type="checkbox" name="subscriptions[]" value="announcements" /> Announcements
	<input type="checkbox" name="subscriptions[]" value="specialoffers" /> Special Offers
	<input type="checkbox" name="subscriptions[]" value="spam" /> General Spam

Or if you want to create an associative array on the server:

	<input type="checkbox" name="subscriptions[announcements]" /> Announcements
	<input type="checkbox" name="subscriptions[specialoffers]" /> Special Offers
	<input type="checkbox" name="subscriptions[spam]" /> General Spam

Other platforms are more simple, not allowing you to name an item, but not requiring you to use the brackets:

	<input type="checkbox" name="subscriptions" value="announcements" /> Announcements
	<input type="checkbox" name="subscriptions" value="specialoffers" /> Special Offers
	<input type="checkbox" name="subscriptions" value="spam" /> General Spam

In Ufront, we've leant more towards the simple way, and don't allow you to create associative arrays (StringMaps in Haxe) from your form input.
The reason for this is that Haxe is best when it is strongly typed, and with PHP, you don't know if `$_POST['subscriptions']` is a string, or an array of strings.

So in ufront, when targeting any platform other than PHP, this will work:

	<input type="checkbox" name="subscriptions" value="announcements" /> Announcements
	<input type="checkbox" name="subscriptions" value="specialoffers" /> Special Offers
	<input type="checkbox" name="subscriptions" value="spam" /> General Spam
	
	for ( subscription in context.request.getAll("subscriptions") ) {
		trace( subscription );
	}

All parameters in the request are turned into a MultiValueMap.
This is a special type, that is essentially a `Map<String, Array<String>>`, but makes it easy to access just a single value, or multiple values if that's what you're expecting.

For example:

	context.request.get("subscription"); // String
	context.request.getAll("subscription"); // Array<String>
	context.request["subscription"]; // shortcut for get()

This is a simple, type safe way to access multiple parameters with the same variables.

But what about PHP?

Well, if we change out inputs to look like this:

	<input type="checkbox" name="subscriptions[]" value="announcements" /> Announcements
	<input type="checkbox" name="subscriptions[]" value="specialoffers" /> Special Offers
	<input type="checkbox" name="subscriptions[]" value="spam" /> General Spam

They will now be accessible in the same way on every platform:

	context.request.get("subscription"); // String
	context.request.getAll("subscription"); // Array<String>
	context.request["subscription"]; // shortcut for get()

The extra `[]` brackets are needed for PHP to register it as multiple values.
On other platforms, and on PHP, we filter these out and just leave the actual name, without the brackets.

Please note you cannot use a named multiple values anymore, such as `name="subscriptions[announcements]"` - this is a limitation of the approach we have taken.

### Request URI

The `req.uri` field shown here is the raw value given by the web server.

For example, if you are configured to use `pathinfo` instead of `mod_rewrite`, you will see this:

	context.request.uri;       // "/index.n/information/about-us/"
	context.getRequestUri();   // "/information/about-us/"

Or if your script is stored in a subdirectory, say "sharedhost.com/myapp/":

	context.request.uri;       // "/myapp/information/about-us/"
	context.getRequestUri();   // "/information/about-us/"

When in doubt, use `context.getRequestUri()`.
See [[02.3.0 HttpContext]] for details about filtering URIs.

### Parsing Multipart Input

It has proven difficult to achieve consistent behaviour across platforms when dealing with multipart input and file uploads.

This behaviour is still being worked out.

The plan is for `HttpRequest` to provide the low level `parseMultipart` method with a similar interface to `neko.Web.parseMultipart`, except that it handles populating the `post` values for you.

From there, we will provide Request Middleware that you can run at the start of your request to handle the uploads in a much more simple way.

If you need upload support at this time, please consider using the native methods for handling uploads on your given platform.
