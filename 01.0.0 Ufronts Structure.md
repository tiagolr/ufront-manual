Ufront's Structure
==================

Ufront is designed for building well structured apps that are both quick to begin and sane to maintain as your project grows bigger (and usually, more complex).

This chapter discusses some of the design concepts that have shaped Ufront's structure:

* [[01.1.0 Model View Controller API]]
* [[01.2.0 Client Server Tasks Tests]]
* [[01.3.0 Cross Platform]]
* [[01.4.0 Replaceable Parts]]
* [[01.5.0 Extensibility]]
* [[01.6.0 3rd Party Libraries]]
