Client, Server, Tasks, Tests
============================

Ufront is a full stack web framework. 
Other frameworks are often designed to work on the server *or* the client.
For example, Django (Python), Ruby on Rails (Ruby), or Laravel (PHP) are common server-side frameworks.
On the Client, it's common to say Angular JS, Ember JS, Backbone, or a mashup of jQuery plugins.
Ufront can run on the client, or on the server, or both.

Each of these contexts have different environments and the code may have to adapt to each.
It will help if we give some simple definitions for terms we will use throughout this manual.

* __Server__:
  
  This is code that runs on a web server.
  This usually means it has access to the File System, the Database, or anything else.
  
  So what goes on the server? 
  Anything which is secret, such as the credentials for sending email, should stay on the server.
  Also anything which can only run on the server.
  For example, you can't connect to a MySQL database from a web browser - we'd have to do that from the server.
  
  In ufront the server will usually be compiled to Neko (.n files) or PHP (.php files).
  Support for NodeJS is experimental, and in future we may support Python, Java, C++ or others.
  
  When compiling the server you should include the `-D server` define.
  
  In your code, you can use conditional compilation to check if you are running on the server:
  
  ```haxe
  #if server
  	trace( 'Only do this if running on the server' );
  #end
  ```

* __Client__
  
  In Ufront, when we talk about "the client" we are talking about the user's web browser.
  Other types of clients exist - a task runner or a native mobile app, but we are focusing on the user's browser.
  
  Compiling for the client involves compiling your Haxe code to Javascript. 
  You should use ths `-D client` define.
  
  Like with the server, you can use conditional compilation to ensure something only runs on the client:
  
  ```haxe
  #if client
  	trace( 'Only do this if running on the client' );
  #end
  ```

* __Tasks__
  
  Often there are tasks you want to run from the Command Line so that you can schedule them to run automatically, or run them on a remote server.
  These include things such as importing data, performing backups, running scheduled tasks etc.
  
  Ufront provides some helpers for building task sets in Neko, and integrating them with your existing models and APIs.
  These then run from the command line.
  
  See [[09.0.0 UFTasks]] for more information.

* __Tests__

  Running tests is a different context yet again.
  
  The entire lifecycle of a web request is represented in the [[02.3.0 HttpContext]].
  To save you from having to create Http Requests (or even more manually, click around in a browser), Ufront allows you to create a "mock" HttpContext.
  This mock HttpContext means you can test how the app would respond to an actual request, without having to be running a live server and creating Http requests.
  
  Running the test suite from a command line, with mocked HttpRequests, makes it easier to make automated testing part of your development process.
  
  For more information on testing in Ufront, see [[11.0.0 Testing]]

Often you will have a `hxml` file for each of these:

	server.hxml
	client.hxml
	tasks.hxml
	tests.hxml

You can compile all of these at once using `ufront build`, or the shorter, `ufront b`.
You can also compile one at a time, for example, `ufront b client`.
