Extensibility
=============

### Extension Points

Both `UfrontApplication` and it's parent class `HttpApplication` and therefore have extension points for you to extend the core behaviour of Ufront.
In fact, `UfrontApplication` is basically just an extension of `HttpApplication` with a few default modules plugged in and configured.

The different extension points are `UFRequestMiddleware`, `UFRequestHandler`, `UFResponseHandler`, `UFLogHandler`.
These are executed in that order, one module at a time, before sending the result to the client.

If an error is encountered, then the `UFErrorHandler`s will run, followed by the `UFLogHandler`s, and then sending the result to the client.

#### Module Types

* __UFRequestMiddleware__
  
  This is middleware that runs as soon as the `HttpContext` is ready.
  It is useful for performing an action before any other processing takes place.
  
  Example: See if a version of the page is cached and can be loaded, saving us from doing all that processing again.
  
* __UFRequestHandler__
  
  Example: The RemotingHandler checks for a `X-Haxe-Remoting` header and processes the request separately if it is found.
  If not it is passed on to the MVCHandler to be handled as per usual.
  
* __UFResponseMiddleware__
  
  Example: Save a cached copy of the page. Or save some data for your metrics / analytics.
  
* __UFLogHandler__
  
  Example: Add `console.log` statements to the output, but only if we are dealing with a `text/html` response.
  Or perhaps saving all logs to a high performance logging API.
  
* __UFErrorHandler__
  
  Example: Render a page with the error message, showing debug if information if it was compiled with "-debug".
  Alternatively, you could set up integration with AirBrake or a similar bug reporting system to notify you and track errors that occur in your app.

#### Set up of Ufront Application

* UFRequestMiddleware
	* Whatever is configured in `UfrontConfiguration.requestMiddleware`, by default this is `InlineSessionMiddleware`.
* UFRequestHandler
	* RemotingHandler
	* MVCHandler
* UFResponseMiddleware
	* Whatever is configured in `UfrontConfiguration.responseMiddleware`, by default this is `InlineSessionMiddleware`.
* UFLogHandler
	* BrowserConsoleLogger if `UfrontConfiguration.disableBrowserTrace` is false.
	* RemotingLogger if `UfrontConfiguration.disableBrowserTrace` is false.
	* FileLogger if `UfrontConfiguration.logFile` is set to a valid filename.
* UFErrorHandler
	* Whatever is configured in `UfrontConfiguration.errorHandlers`, be default this is `ErrorPageHandler`.

### Injection

Any class you find useful can be added to the HttpApplication's injector, meaning it can then be used in any handlers, middleware, controllers or APIs.
This provides an easy way to add functionality that isn't included into `ufront-mvc`.

For example, the various email sending tools in `ufront-mail` can be injected, and they bring significant functionality to your app.
