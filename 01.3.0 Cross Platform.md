Cross Platform
==============

As well as compiling to the different [contexts](01.2.0 Client Server Tasks Tests), Ufront aims to support multiple platforms in these contexts. For each context, possible targets include:

* __Server__:
  * Stable: Neko, PHP.
  * Experimental: NodeJS.
  * Possible: Java, Python, C++, C#.
* __Client__:
  * Stable: Browser JS.
  * Possible: Node Webkit, OpenFL.
* __Tasks__:
  * Stable: Neko.
  * Possible: Any Haxe "sys" target.
* __Tests__:
  * Stable: Neko, PHP.
  * Possible: Any Haxe target.

See [[14.0.0 Platform Support]] for details about the level of support on different platforms.

### Design Implications

The choice to support multiple platforms has led to some design decisions that might not otherwise be obvious.
For example:

* __We have tried to build as much infrastructure as possible on top of base classes and interfaces that can be implemented on multiple platforms.__
  
  As one example, we have HttpRequest and HttpResponse objects.
  If a platform can supply these objects, it is a long way toward supporting `ufront-mvc` already.
  
  As another example, when we are dealing with web sessions, we have the [[07.1.0 UFHttpSession]] interface.
  Currently we only have one functional implementation - FileSession, which writes the session data to a file on the server's hard drive.
  A future Java platform targeting Google App Engine would not be able to write to the File System though, so we have built the interface keeping in mind a future implementation that must work without file system access.
  
* __We have tried to support asynchronous code flow in as many places as possible.__

  Because platforms like Browser JS and Node JS are designed to be used with asynchronous callbacks, we have tried to support an async, non-blocking architecture in our core.
  On synchronous platforms, like Neko or PHP, we support these async styles, even if they end up running synchronous, blocking calls - because their platform is different.
  The advantage here is that as much of the system as possible can switch between a synchronous platform (like PHP) and an asynchronous platform (like JS) with as little friction as possible.
  
  As an example, a controller can return a normal value if it is available, or a `Future` if we are waiting for an asynchronous callback to complete.
  
  All middleware, request handlers, log handlers etc are set up to support asynchronous modules as well.
  
  If we were only building for Neko or PHP, this asynchronous, non-blocking API would seem like needless complexity.
  Because we are trying to enable you to jump between platforms with little friction, we have chosen to embrace this extra complexity.
