Request Lifecycle
=================

Every time a user visits a page on your site, they create a request, using HTTP, and get a response, also over HTTP.
The HttpRequest and HttpResponse form the basics of any request from the client - we read the input (HttpRequest) and write the output (HttpResponse).

Each request goes through the following lifecycle:

- We set up the `HttpContext` object with our `HttpRequest` and `HttpResponse`.
- This `HttpContext` is then passed through the various modules:
  
  	- Each UFRequestMiddleware, in order.
  	- Each UFRequestHandler, in order.
  	- Each UFResponseMiddleware, in order.
  	- Each UFLogHandler, in order.
  
  Each module has can change some details of the `HttpContext`, or mark parts of the request as complete.
  For example, a request middleware could load a result from the cache, write it to the `HttpResponse`, and so mark the request as complete, so no further processing is required.
  
  If an error is encountered, then the `HttpContext` is then passed through:
  
  	- Each UFErrorHandler, in order. The given error value is also passed to the error handler.
  	- Each UFLogHandler, in order.
  
- Once each module has run it's course, we flush the `HttpResponse` to the client, and wrap up the request.

### Platform Differences

* On __PHP__, for every request, a UfrontApplication is created, a HttpContext is created, and the request is executed.
* __Neko__ without `neko.Web.cacheModule` behaves the same as PHP.
* __Neko__ with `neko.Web.cacheModule` will load the UfrontApplication on the first request, and keep one copy alive for each thread. For each request, one of the existing threads will be used, the `HttpContext` will be created, and the request will be executed.
* On __Node JS__, a `UfrontApplication` is created, and a `HttpServer` launched. Each HTTP request from the server is then converted to a `HttpContext` and executed accordingly.
